It took a lot of effort to push forward and overcome the setbacks, but here we are. Pallad is officially in Open Beta, and that means you can download it from the Chrome Web Store and [install it in your favorite browser](https://get.pallad.co/extension) (you're not using Safari, are you?). Open beta means it only works on Berkeley and Zeko DevNet, you shouldn't use your Auro/Clorio mainnet credentials (but they will work). We have managed to deliver a few major milestones in the last few months.

## Web Connector

First of all, there's a new Web Connector interface. It follows the [Mina Core RFC-0008](https://github.com/MinaFoundation/Core-Grants/blob/main/RFCs/rfc-0008-wallet-provider-api.md) specification. This means that when Auro finishes implementing it, all Mina browser extension wallets will follow the same specification, making it easier for developers.

## UI overhaul

If you joined the party early, there's a chance you've seen our initial UI with dark gray and blue colors. It's officially a thing of the past and we've undergone a makeover. New Pallad's UI has been designed by one of the best designers in the game.

## Zeko Integration

We have been working on the integration with Zeko. The Zeko DevNet is now all available in Pallad, and you should be able to switch to Zeko and use it with our Web Connector interface.

## Next steps

We will let users play with Pallad on Berkeley, and when it is mainnet ready, Pallad will undergo a security audit to ensure the highest standards, quality and security of our product.
